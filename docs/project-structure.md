# 🗄️ Project Structure

Most of the code lives in the `src` folder and looks something like this:

```sh
src
|
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- config            # global configurations, exported env variables etc.
|
+-- features          # feature based modules
|
+-- hooks             # shared hooks used across the entire application
|
+-- lib               # reusable libraries preconfigured for the application
|
+-- providers         # all of the application providers
|
+-- routes            # routes of the application
|
+-- stores            # global state stores
|
+-- test              # test utilities and mocks
|
+-- types             # shared types used across the application
|
+-- utils             # shared utility functions
```

For easy scalability and maintenance, organize most of the code within the features folder. Each feature folder should contain code specific to that feature, keeping things neatly separated. This approach helps prevent mixing feature-related code with shared components, making it simpler to manage and maintain the codebase compared to having many files in a flat folder structure. By adopting this method, you can enhance collaboration, readability, and scalability in the application's architecture.

A feature could have the following structure:

```sh
src/features/awesome-feature
|
+-- api         # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
|
+-- assets      # assets folder can contain all the static files for a specific feature
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- stores      # state stores for a specific feature
|
+-- types       # typescript types for TS specific feature domain
|
+-- utils       # utility functions for a specific feature
```

Do not import across the features. Instead, compose different features at the application level in the `routes` folder. This way, you can ensure that each feature is independent and can be easily moved or removed without affecting other parts of the application.

To forbid cross-feature imports, you can use ESLint:

```js
'import/no-restricted-paths': [
    'error',
    {
        zones: [
            {
                target: './src/features/comments',
                from: './src/features',
                except: ['./comments'],
            },
            {
                target: './src/features/discussions',
                from: './src/features',
                except: ['./discussions'],
            },
            {
                target: './src/features/teams',
                from: './src/features',
                except: ['./teams'],
            },
            {
                target: './src/features/users',
                from: './src/features',
                except: ['./users'],
            },
        ],
    },
],
```
